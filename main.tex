% Professional Summary
\subsection*{Summary}
Software Engineering student with some experience through personal and academic projects, 
currently building and strengthening skills in Machine Learning, backend development, and 
web technologies. Familiar with Python for data analysis, basic ML models, automation, and 
AI-driven prototypes such as chatbots and introductory computer vision systems using YOLO. 
Working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for creating simple web interfaces and 
connecting them with backend logic. Used to experimenting, learning by doing, and turning 
ideas into functional (sometimes imperfect) prototypes. Actively interested in expanding 
knowledge in areas like applied AI, intelligent systems, data-driven applications, and 
real-world software problem solving. Motivated, curious, and adaptable, with a 
clear focus on continuous learning and technical growth.
